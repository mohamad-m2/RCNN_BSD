# Pitting localization and segmentation using RCNN
in this work, we try to detect and localize surface defects of type "pitting" on Ball Screw Drive dataset [[1]](#1). the dataset consists of 1104  RGB high resolution images 
with 394 annotated images with pitting defects, the pitting size varries betwwen very small pittings and large ones. also the dataset contain images with multiple pittings having different sizes.
